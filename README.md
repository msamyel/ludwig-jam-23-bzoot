# Coots and Bzoot
Submission for the 2023 #LudwigJam

Hello, this is my submission, a simple game created in few days for the [LudwigJam 2023](https://itch.io/jam/ludwig-2023).
It was created in Unity, and all assets are original 
(although sprites of Coots were loosely traced from pictures on [Coots' twitter profile](https://twitter.com/lilcoots))
